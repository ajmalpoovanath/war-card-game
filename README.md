# War Card Game

## Overview

War Card Game is a simple iOS card game developed as part of my journey to learn iOS app development. The game is based on the classic War card game, where players draw cards and the player with the higher card wins the round. The app was built using Swift with guidance from the course provided by [codewithchris.com](https://codewithchris.com).

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Basic gameplay mechanics of the War card game.
- Score tracking to determine the winner.

## Installation

Since I am not currently enrolled in the Apple Developer Program, I am unable to publish the app on the App Store or TestFlight. To test the app, you will need to clone the project and run it locally using Xcode on a Mac. Here's how you can do it:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/war-card-game.git

   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

   ```sh
   cd war-card-game
   open WarCardGame.xcodeproj

   ```

3. Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or your connected iOS device.
